# Clients

## Creating clients

There several ways for a client to be created, including:

* Admin Portal > Create Client
* Admin Portal > Client CSV Import
* Client Portal (if client registration is enabled on Settings > Client Portal)
API
* Integrator: Zapier, Integromat or APISync

A "Client" can either represent a person or a company. If only the contact information is set the contact name will be used as the client's display name. If the client's name is set then it will be used instead.

There are three different client id fields:

* **$client.id** : Autogenerated and used by the API (ie, 7WR07SC)
* **$client.number**: Autogenerated and can be configured on Settings > Generated -Numbers (ie, 0001)
* **$client.id_number**: Standard field which can be used to store the clientâ€™s number from a different system

# Viewing Clients

To view a client, select one from the list of clients on the client panel, or by linking to it from a related invoice, project, task, or transaction.  

## Overview

The overview tab presents a quick look at the paid to date, and amount owing of a client, public and private notes about the client, followed by a list of interactive buttons to see a client-filtered list of any category.  

You can select from **Groups, Invoices, Payments, Recurring Invoices, Quotes, Credits, Projects, Tasks, or Expenses**.  Hover your mouse over one of these categories, and the icon will turn into a "plus" symbol; it is a clickable button to create a new invoice, quote, payment, etc.  On mobile devices, you can touch and hold anywhere on the button to create new, instead of viewing a client-filtered list.

The **Client Portal** link at the bottom will take you into a new web browser tab or window, to view the client portal directly.

The "Settings" button at the bottom will take you to **Client Settings** where you can edit and configure client-specific rules, templates, behavior, etc.

The kebab menu button in the top right of this panel also has many of these functions, and is available on every tab.

# Editing Clients



## Contacts

Every *client* has a *contacts* list, allowing you to add as many *contacts* as you like to represent any given *client*.  When editing a client, you can see existing contacts under "Details" tab.  You can edit these by double-tapping a client in the client list to edit, and choosing the "Contacts" tab.  

When viewing a *client*, all *contacts*, and links to their client portals, can be viewed under the "Details" tab.  The difference between viewing, and editing a client, is single or double clicking on the client listing directly.  As an admin, or a user with edit client permission, you can enter the client portal as any available *contact* in the list, to view or 

You can only add new *contacts* to a *client* from the admin portal.  Customers cannot add more *contacts* to their *client* entry from the client portal themselves.

### Contacts and the Client Portal

*Contacts* are each given their own profiles in the client portal, logging in with the emails you assign them, allowing each contact to set their own password and personal settings or details on the client portal, regardless of which *client* they represent. 

When an individual self-registers on the client portal, their name and email will be added as *contact* data under a new *client*.  After signing in, they will have the opportunity to edit their *client* details in the "Profile" menu, such as company name and contact information. 

Email addresses for *contacts* are considered authentic.  For example, if an individual attempts to self-register while already being included as a *contact* for another *client* entry, the self-registration portal will force them to resubmit their personal information using a new email address, or have their email address removed from the other *client* listing. 

## Documents

The "Documents" tab allows only you, to as an admin, or a user with edit client permission, to upload or delete virtually any file type.  The files uploaded can be viewed and downloaded by any user with permission to view clients, or the clients themselves through the client portal.

The files uploaded through the Documents tab are saved to the web server directory under public/storage, in a nested folder structure.  If you are curious, the hash name of the file represents the file name of the original file in this nested folder structure at public/storage.  

The security implication of being stored in public/storage is that the documents uploaded should not include sensitive information because the webserver (nginx or apache) has looser restrictions about accessing these files with direct paths, admins are responsible for hardening the server against scraping, by obscuring information but it cannot be considered truly secure.  This feature would be best for distributing or sharing agreements, forms, licensed software, digital content, and invoice or project notes, but be careful not to include any sensitive information like passwords, payment details, or other confidential data.  

## Ledger







## Grouping settings

If many clients share the same settings, for example, the same currency or email reminder settings, you can create a group on Settings > Groups to, as the name implies, group together the settings.

For most settings, the app will first check if the client has a value in place, if not it will check if the client belongs to a group and if that group defines a value. Finally, it will use the default value set at the company level.

The benefit of using groups is that if in the future you need to change the setting you can change it one place rather than having to update multiple clients individually. Without groups, bulk updating client settings would require using the API or an integrator.
