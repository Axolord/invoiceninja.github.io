# Getting started

## Overview

Invoice Ninja is an invoicing application which makes sending invoices and receiving payments simple and easy. Our latest version is a clean slate rewrite of our popular invoicing application which builds on the existing feature set and adds a wide range of features and enhancements the community has asked for.

## Architecture
