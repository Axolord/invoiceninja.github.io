## Stripe Integration

In v5 of Invoice Ninja we have introduced Stripe Connect using OAuth. This integration provides a secure way to integrate your Stripe account into Invoice Ninja.

When you migrate your data across, we automatically create your Stripe account, however we need you to authorize via OAuth your Stripe account with Invoice Ninja. 

To do this, navigate to Settings > Online Payments > Configure Gateways. In the Stripe driver you'll see the following:

Click on this button and you'll be taken to a page like this:

Select the account you wish to connect and we will look after the rest!!
