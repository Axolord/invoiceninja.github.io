## Hosted Migration

Sometimes, the hassle of managing your own Self Hosted Server is just too much. 

We've made transferring from your self hosted server (and vice versa) simple.

First signup for one of our [free](https://invoiceninja.invoicing.co/client/subscriptions/VolejRejNm/purchase) or [paid](https://invoiceninja.invoicing.co/client/subscriptions/7LDdwRb1YK/purchase) plans.

Next you will want to ensure you are on the latest version of v5 and then perform an export of your data.

Once the export is completed you will receive an email with a download link to the backup file. Now just log into your Hosted v5 Account and navigate to Settings > Import | Export and use the .zip file to import your data across.
