## License

We receive many queries about the Invoice Ninja sourcecode/application license and what is considered within the license and outside of the license. We feel it is important the community understands our interpretation of the license so there is no confusion about how this software can be used.

Invoice Ninja uses the Elastic License 2.0, which allows for flexibility in personal use of the software and protection for our commercial use of the code in our Hosted SaaS product. Here are some examples of how the code can and cannot be used:

Here are some examples of how the code can and cannot be used:

### 1. Bob the IT services provider.

Bob, an IT services provider, uses Invoice Ninja to invoice and receive payments. He is free to modify and extend the source code as needed, but must not remove the attributions to Invoice Ninja. To remove these attributions, he would need to purchase an annual Whitelabel license.

### 2. Sally the WebHost provider.

Sally, a WebHost provider, installs Invoice Ninja for her clients on her own or 3rd party infrastructure and bills them for the service. This is within the license usage of Invoice Ninja.

### 3. EvilCorp 3000

EvilCorp 3000 copies the Invoice Ninja repository and wants to resell it as their own SaaS product. This is not within the license of Invoice Ninja and they would need to discuss a commercial license with Invoice Ninja LLC.

### 4. Hybrid SaaS Co

Hybrid SaaS Co develops their own CRM SaaS product and wants to add Invoice Ninja as a complimentary offering. Because they are reselling the Invoice Ninja application, they would need to agree to a commercial license with Invoice Ninja LLC to use the code.

### Conclusion:

In summary, if you are using the app to bill clients for services, it is free. But if you plan to resell/create a SaaS which also offers invoicing, you need to become a reseller of our application and agree to a commercial license with Invoice Ninja LLC.
